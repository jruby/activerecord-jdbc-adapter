== 1.0.0

- Thanks to David Kellum, Dmitry Denisov, Dwayne Litzenberger, Gregor
  Schmidt, James Walker, John Duff, Joshua Suggs, Nicholas J Kreucher,
  Peter Donald, Geoff Longman, Uwe Kubosch, Youhei Kondou, Michael
  Pitman, Alex B, and Ryan Bell for their contributions to this
  release.

- Deprecate jdbc_adapter/rake_tasks
- (1.0.0.beta1)

  currently 100%, SQLite3 is close.

- PLEASE NOTE: ActiveRecord in Rails 3 has changed in a way that
  doesn't allow non-standard DBs (such as the Derby and H2 embedded
  DBs) to work. We're investigating the effort required to support
  these databases and hope to have something for a future release.
- ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-91: Fix schema search path for PostgreSQL (Alex
  Kuebo)

== 0.9.2

- The main, highly awaited fix for this release is a solution to the
  rake db:create/db:drop issue. The main change is a new 'jdbc' rails
  generator that should be run once to prepare a Rails application to
  use JDBC. The upside of this generator is that you no longer will
  need to alter database.yml for JDBC. See the README.txt for details.

  return RubyFloat

- Add patch supplied in JRUBY-3489 (patch by Jean-Dominique Morani)
- Various Oracle fixes by edsono
- JRUBY-2688: Don't hard-code MySQL connection character encoding to
  utf8

== 0.9

- Now updated to support ActiveRecord 2.2. JNDI-based connections will
  automatically connect/disconnect for every AR connection pool
  checkout/checkin. For best results, set your pool: parameter >= the
  actual maximum size of the JNDI connection pool. (We'll look at how
  to eliminate the need to configure AR's pool in the future.)

- Authoritative repository now hosted at

  svn trunk cleaned out.

== 0.8.2

- Added an optional config key called :dialect. Using :dialect allows you to
  override the default SQL dialect for the driver class being used. There are
  a few cases for this:
  - Using using Sybase w/ the jTDS driver.
  - Using rebranded drivers.
  - It makes more sense to use :dialect, rather then :driver when using JNDI.
- JRUBY-2619: Typo with :test config causing problems with dev database (Igor Minar)
- 20524, JRUBY-2612: Since when did I think that there was a #true? method on Object?

== 0.8

  backward compatible with previous JRuby releases. Hence the version bump.

== 0.7

- PLEASE NOTE: This release is not compatible with JRuby releases earlier than
  1.0.3 or 1.1b2. If you must use JRuby 1.0.2 or earlier, please install the
  0.6 release.

  introduced in Rails 2.0 for third-party adapters. Rails 2.0 compatibility is
  introduced.
- Add dependency on ActiveRecord >= 1.14 (from the Rails 1.1.x release)
- New drivers (jdbc-XXX) and adapter (activerecord-jdbcXXX-adapter) gems
  available separately. See the README.txt file for details.
- Plain "jdbc" driver is still available if you want to use the full
  driver/url way of specifying the driver.
- More bugfixes to Oracle and SQLServer courtesy of Ola & ThoughtWorks

== 0.5

- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.1 release
- It is no longer necessary to specify :driver and :url configuration
  parameters for the mysql, postgresql, oracle, derby, hsqldb, and h2
  adapters. The previous configuration is still valid and compatible, but for
  new applications, this makes it possible to use the exact same database.yml
  configuration as Rails applications running under native Ruby.
- JDBC drivers can now be dynamically loaded by Ruby code, without being on
  the classpath prior to launching JRuby. Simply use "require
  'jdbc-driver.jar'" in JRuby code to add it to the runtime classpath.
