# ActiveRecord JDBC Adapter

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/activerecord-jdbc-adapter.svg)][7]

ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter (AR-JDBC) is the main database adapter for Rails'
*ActiveRecord* component that can be used with [JRuby][0].
ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter provides full or nearly full support for:
**MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite3**.  In the near future there are plans to
add support **MSSQL**. Unless we get more contributions we will not be going
beyond these four adapters.  Note that the amount of work needed to get
another adapter is not huge but the amount of testing required to make sure
that adapter continues to work is not something we can do with the resources
we currently have.

For Oracle database users you are encouraged to use
https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced.

Version **50.x** supports Rails version 5.0.x and it lives on branch 50-stable.
Version **51.x** supports Rails version 5.1.x and is currently on master until
its first release. The minimum version of JRuby for 50+ is JRuby **9.1.x** and
JRuby 9.1+ requires Java 7 or newer (we recommend Java 8 at minimum).

## Using ActiveRecord JDBC

### Inside Rails

To use AR-JDBC with JRuby on Rails:

1. Choose the adapter you wish to gem install. The following pre-packaged
adapters are available:

  - MySQL (`activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter`)
  - PostgreSQL (`activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter`)
  - SQLite3 (`activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter`)

2. If you're generating a new Rails application, use the following command:

    jruby -S rails new sweetapp

3. Configure your *database.yml* in the normal Rails style:

```yml
development:
  adapter: mysql2 # or mysql
  database: blog_development
  username: blog
  password: 1234
```

For JNDI data sources, you may simply specify the JNDI location as follows, it's
recommended to use the same adapter: setting as one would configure when using
"bare" (JDBC) connections e.g. :

```yml
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  jndi: jdbc/PostgreDS
```

**NOTE:** any other settings such as *database:*, *username:*, *properties:* make
no difference since everything is already configured on the JNDI DataSource end.

JDBC driver specific properties might be set if you use an URL to specify the DB
or preferably using the *properties:* syntax:

```yml
production:
  adapter: mysql
  username: blog
  password: blog
  url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog?profileSQL=true"
  properties: # specific to com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    socketTimeout:  60000
    connectTimeout: 60000
```

### Standalone with ActiveRecord

Once the setup is made (see below) you can establish a JDBC connection like this
(e.g. for `activerecord-jdbcderby-adapter`):

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  adapter: 'sqlite3',
  database: 'db/my-database'
)
```

#### Using Bundler

Proceed as with Rails; specify `ActiveRecord` in your Bundle along with the
chosen JDBC adapter(s), this time sample *Gemfile* for MySQL:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord', '~> 5.0.6'
gem 'activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter', :platform => :jruby
```

When you `require 'bundler/setup'` everything will be set up for you as expected.

#### Without Bundler

Install the needed gems with JRuby, for example:

    gem install activerecord -v "~> 5.0.6"
    gem install activerecord-jdbc-adapter --ignore-dependencies

If you wish to use the adapter for a specific database, you can install it
directly and the (jdbc-) driver gem (dependency) will be installed as well:

    jruby -S gem install activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter

Your program should include:

```ruby
require 'active_record'
require 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter' if defined? JRUBY_VERSION
```

## Source

The source for activerecord-jdbc-adapter is available using git:

    git clone git://github.com/jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter.git

Please note that the project manages multiple gems from a single repository,
if you're using *Bundler* >= 1.2 it should be able to locate all gemspecs from
the git repository. Sample *Gemfile* for running with (MySQL) master:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter', :github => 'jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter'
gem 'activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter', :github => 'jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter'
```
