  MySQL, you need to add

        allowMultiQueries: true
  in database.yml.

## 0.9.5

- The MSSQL release, courtesy of Mike Williams and Lonely
  Planet.
- JRuby + AR-JDBC is now seen as the hassle-free way of using Rails
  with SQLServer!
- Many fixes for MSSQL, including ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-18,
  ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-41, ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-56, ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-94,
  ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-99, JRUBY-3805, JRUBY-3793, JRUBY-4221
- All tests pass on Rails 3.0.0.beta3!

## 0.9.4

- ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-96: DB2 JdbcSpec cannot dump schema correctly
  (Youhei Kondou)
- ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-97: Dont use Rails 3 deprecated constants (David
  Calavera)
- Updates for rake db:schema:dump compatibility with Rails 2.3+ and
  MySQL (Joakim Kolsj�)
- Rails 3.0.0.beta2 compatibility
- Return of Derby, H2, Hsqldb support (requires AR >= 3.0.0.beta2)

## 0.9.3

- Rails 3 compatibility
- PLEASE NOTE: ActiveRecord in Rails 3 has changed in a way that
  doesn't allow non-standard DBs (such as the Derby and H2 embedded
  DBs) to work. We're investigating the effort required to support
  these databases and hope to have something for a future release.
- ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-91: Fix schema search path for PostgreSQL (Alex
  Kuebo)
- ACTIVERECORD_JDBC-87: DB2 ID insert fix (Youhei Kondou)

## 0.9.2

- The main, highly awaited fix for this release is a solution to the
  rake db:create/db:drop issue. The main change is a new 'jdbc' rails
  generator that should be run once to prepare a Rails application to
  use JDBC. The upside of this generator is that you no longer will
  need to alter database.yml for JDBC. See the README.txt for details.

## 0.9

- Now updated to support ActiveRecord 2.2. JNDI-based connections will
  automatically connect/disconnect for every AR connection pool
  checkout/checkin. For best results, set your pool: parameter >= the
  actual maximum size of the JNDI connection pool. (We'll look at how
  to eliminate the need to configure AR's pool in the future.)
- NEW! Informix support courtesy of Javier Fernandez-Ivern.

## 0.8.2

- Added an optional config key called :dialect. Using :dialect allows you to
  override the default SQL dialect for the driver class being used. There are
  a few cases for this:
  - Using using Sybase w/ the jTDS driver.
  - Using rebranded drivers.
  - It makes more sense to use :dialect, rather then :driver when using JNDI.
- JRUBY-2619: Typo with :test config causing problems with dev database (Igor Minar)
- 20524, JRUBY-2612: Since when did I think that there was a #true? method on Object?

## 0.8

  backward compatible with previous JRuby releases. Hence the version bump.

## 0.7

- PLEASE NOTE: This release is not compatible with JRuby releases earlier than
  1.0.3 or 1.1b2. If you must use JRuby 1.0.2 or earlier, please install the
  0.6 release.
- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.3 and JRuby 1.1b2 releases

  introduced in Rails 2.0 for third-party adapters. Rails 2.0 compatibility is
  introduced.
- Add dependency on ActiveRecord >= 1.14 (from the Rails 1.1.x release)
- New drivers (jdbc-XXX) and adapter (activerecord-jdbcXXX-adapter) gems
  available separately. See the README.txt file for details.
- Plain "jdbc" driver is still available if you want to use the full
  driver/url way of specifying the driver.
- More bugfixes to Oracle and SQLServer courtesy of Ola & ThoughtWorks

## 0.5

- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.1 release
- It is no longer necessary to specify :driver and :url configuration
  parameters for the mysql, postgresql, oracle, derby, hsqldb, and h2
  adapters. The previous configuration is still valid and compatible, but for
  new applications, this makes it possible to use the exact same database.yml
  configuration as Rails applications running under native Ruby.
- JDBC drivers can now be dynamically loaded by Ruby code, without being on
  the classpath prior to launching JRuby. Simply use "require
  'jdbc-driver.jar'" in JRuby code to add it to the runtime classpath.
- Updates to HSQL, MS SQLServer, Postgres, Oracle and Derby adapters
